# kernel-genetic-algorithm
Gaussian Kernel Non-Parametric Regression combined with K-means clustering and Classification and Regression Trees (to do dimensional scaling for the independent variables). We use standard genetic algorithm to find the optimal bandwidths based on Generalized Cross-Validation (GCV) criteria.

The code for reading _netcdf_ files also included.
