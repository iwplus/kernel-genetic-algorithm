# kernel-genetic-algorithm
Gaussian Kernel Non-Parametric Regression combined with K-means clustering and Classification and Regression Trees (to do dimensional scaling for the independent variables). We use standard genetic algorithm to find the optimal bandwidths based on Generalized Cross-Validation (GCV) criteria.

The code for reading _netcdf_ files also included.

**Note**: use _varphi-cli.py_ for command window-like experience. For "one-time" running/processing, simply use the _varphi-2018.py_
